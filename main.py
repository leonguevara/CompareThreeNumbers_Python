#   We ask for and read three numbers
number1 = float(input("Give me the first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Give me the second number: "))
number3 = float(input("Give me the third number: "))

#   We find which of the three numbers is the biggest
if number1 >= number2 and number1 >= number3:
    biggest = number1
elif number2 >= number1 and number2 >= number3:
    biggest = number2
else:
    biggest = number3

#   We display our findings
print("The biggest number among the three is: " + str(biggest))
